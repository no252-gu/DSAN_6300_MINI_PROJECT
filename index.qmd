## Overview

Every day, thousands of flights crisscross American skies. Behind the routine of air travel lies a complex web of delays, cancellations, and operational challenges that affect millions of passengers annually.

This project analyzes **April 2019 flight data** from the U.S. Department of Transportation to uncover patterns in airline performance, airport operations, and flight disruptions. Using over 600,000 flight records, we reveal when flights are most delayed, which airports struggle most with on-time performance, and what drives flight cancellations.


## What Questions We're Answering

This analysis addresses five critical questions about flights:

### 1. **When do people fly?**

### 2. **Which airlines have the most extreme delays?**

### 3. **Which airports are the worst performers?**

### 4. **Why do flights get cancelled?**
