## Project Overview

This website presents a comprehensive analysis of U.S. airline performance data, examining flight delays, cancellations, and operational patterns across airlines and airports. The project was completed as part of **DSAN 6300** coursework, demonstrating skills in:

- Database design and SQL query development
- Data analysis and statistical interpretation
- Data visualization and storytelling

## Data Source

**Dataset**: Airline On-Time Performance and Causes of Delay

**Provider**: U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics

**Time Period**: April 2019

**Records**: 600,000+ individual flight records

The dataset includes detailed information about:

- Flight dates, airlines, and routes
- Departure and arrival times (scheduled vs. actual)
- Delay durations and causes
- Cancellation information and reasons
- Airport and carrier identifiers

**Official Source**: [https://www.transtats.bts.gov/](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)

## Methodology

### Database Design

The analysis utilized a dimensional data model with:

- **Fact Table**: `al_perf` containing flight performance metrics
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `L_AIRLINE_ID`: Airline names and codes
  - `L_AIRPORT_ID` / `L_AIRPORT`: Airport identifiers and locations
  - `L_WEEKDAYS`: Day of week mappings
  - `L_CANCELATION`: Cancellation reason codes

### Analysis Tools

- **SQL**: PostgreSQL for data querying and aggregation
- **R**: Data manipulation and visualization
  - `tidyverse` for data wrangling
  - `ggplot2` for visualization
  - `kableExtra` for formatted tables
- **Quarto**: Website generation and publishing


## Key Findings Summary

### System Volume
- **106,575 flights** on the busiest day (Monday)
- Clear weekday/weekend pattern driven by business travel
- Daily volumes range from ~85,000 to ~107,000 flights

### Delays
- **Maximum delay**: 2,620 minutes (43+ hours)
- **Southwest Oregon Regional (OTH)**: 47-minute average delay
- Extreme variability between routine operations and worst-case scenarios

### Cancellations
- **14,488 flights cancelled** in April 2019
- **Weather** is the dominant cause at most airports
- Approximately 2% cancellation rate overall
